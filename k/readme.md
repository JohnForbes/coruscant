This directory is intended to hold classes.
It is intended that the classes are primarily used to structure data.
Where possible there is a bias to writing function code rather than method code.
This allows for easier pairing of tests with functions, as well as looser coupling.
However this is not applied strictly, and each class file has the associated test contained within the the same file as the class code.
